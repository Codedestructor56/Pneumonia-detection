# Pneumonia-detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: pneumonia and normal. The system will be trained on a dataset of labeled chest X-ray images, using deep learning algorithms to extract features and learn patterns that distinguish pneumonia cases from normal ones.
